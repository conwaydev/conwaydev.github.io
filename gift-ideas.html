<div class="mt-8">
  <p class="leading-large">
    Thank you for taking a look at this very important part of the world wide
    web, Justin Conway’s <em>material wants in life</em>. At one point I wrote a
    <a href="https://want-project.web.app/" class="underline"
      >web application</a
    >
    for this.
  </p>
  <h2 class="mt-4 lg:mt-8 font-sans tracking-tight font-bold text-3xl">
    What do you give the man who has everything he needs?
  </h2>
  <p class="mt-4 lg:mt-8">
    Great question, ideally nothing. I highly recommend not gifting me anything
    and instead donating to something worthwhile such as the non-profit I'm
    volunteering at,
    <a href="https://vetswhocode.io/" class="underline">Vets Who Code</a>.
    If you're still listening here are some items that are on my ever-growing
    wishlist:
  </p>
  <h2
    class="border-t-2 pt-4 mt-4 lg:pt-8 lg:mt-8 font-sans tracking-tight font-bold"
  >
    Wants:
  </h2>
  <div id="root">Loading...</div>
</div>

<p class="mt-4 lg:mt-8 border-t-2 pt-4 lg:pt-8">
  That's it! If you see the list and you're still thinking about items, then
  babysitting is becoming an increasingly more valuable gift. Appreciate you
  taking the time to read this, but seriously just donate what you can to
  <a href="https://vetswhocode.io/" class="underline">https://vetswhocode.io/</a
  >.
